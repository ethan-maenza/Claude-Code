   - Lint commands
   - Technology stack details
4. Copy `BEADS-WORKFLOW.md` to repo root (if not present)

## Not Used As Reference

**Important:** These templates are **documentation only**, not programmatically referenced.

- Each repo has its own `CLAUDE.md` file
- Templates live here for **easy copying** when setting up new repos
- Changes to templates don't affect existing repos
